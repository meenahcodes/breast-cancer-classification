# Breast Cancer Classification using PCA and Logistic Regression

This is a machine learning project that classifies breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign. 
The project demonstrates how to use PCA for dimensionality reduction and Logistic Regression for classification.

## Project Overview

Objective: To develop a robust model for predicting breast cancer outcomes.
Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (from scikit-learn).
Techniques: 
  - Dimensionality Reduction:Applied PCA to reduce 30 features down to 3 components, retaining ~73% of the variance.
  - Classification: Implemented Logistic Regression.
  - Evaluation: Assessed model performance using accuracy and ROC-AUC; visualized the ROC curve.
